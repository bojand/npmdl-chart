# npmdl

Plot NPM download counts over time 

## Usage

```
go run *.go
```

Then browse http://localhost:8080/express .

Example chart:

[![Express downloads over time](http://npmdl.herokuapp.com/chart/express)](http://npmdl.herokuapp.com/chart/express)

## Why?

Yes this could be built with just [frontend JavaScript](https://npm-stat.com/).

Just experimenting with [https://golang.org/](Go).

Also this provides a mechanism for embedding the NPM download chart similar to [https://nodei.co/](https://nodei.co/) which does not work any more. Plus with some additional options.
